<h3>Finding opportunities</h3>

**Where is the money?**

The important thing to understand is that ultimately money comes from knowledge and connections. Like money, these are not distributed evenly, but there is almost always something you can do about that. I’ve had to start from scratch several times over my career, so by now I’ve worked out a process for dealing with it that I will describe here.

My first step is always to find out more about what is going on in the world and where the opportunities have gone. There is always some tool that lots of people are using to organize events. In 1990 it was local newspapers, in 1997 it was craigslist.org, in 2004 it was Yahoo email lists and as of early 2014, it is Meetup and Eventbrite. Large cities will have dozens or hundreds of free events listed on these sites and smaller ones will have at least a handful. 

Go to as many events as you can and watch the people there. This will probably be uncomfortable. Watch the people there carefully:<ul>
<li>Are they friendly or not?</li>
<li>Is there a sense of plenty here or not? </li>
<li>Is there a sense of energy and excitement here or not? </li></ul>
You’re looking for communities that are friendly, energetic, and generous. Energetic and generous are more important than friendly, since unfriendliness is easier to overcome than stinginess and lack of energy. Also, selfish or sad communities tend to have a lot of bad luck. 

Make small talk with people and collect as much information as possible:
* What kind of work are these people doing?
* Does it pay well?
* Do they like it? 
* Are they optimistic about their professional future? 
You’re looking for something that can support you and also will still be around after you’ve done what you need to do to get these jobs because that can take a while.

Once you’ve determined that opportunities exist in this circle, you need to figure out whether they’re within your reach. Try asking people:
* What were they doing before they did this job?
* What did they have to know before they could get hired?
* What would you have to know or do to get hired?

You’re not necessarily going to get this far on your first visit. Normally (unless you are very good at making friends out of strangers), you might have to show up five or six times before people get used to seeing you. But usually you can get a rough idea of whether there are opportunities in this network and how likely these might be opportunities for you (and therefore, whether its worth your time to go back) in one or two visits.

Whenever you find a community that has opportunities, join their meetup or mailing list and try to find out where else these people are going so that you can too. Generally, the same people belong to several different communities, and often there are similar opportunities in the other communities. Also, the more familiar you are to people, the more generous they are likely to be with information, introductions, and other kinds of help that can be useful.

None of this is going to be easy, and it is likely that you are going to feel like an outsider for a very long time. (If you were not an outsider, you would already be there, and if your home community had enough opportunity, you wouldn’t have had to look anywhere else.) Learning to deal with this is a skill just like being able to talk to people and get good information from them is a skill. And the thing about skill is that you’ll always get better at it the more you practice. 

Even mistakes are helpful, because mistakes let you figure out what not to do. In fact, if you are not making any mistakes, that probably means you are not taking any chances. Don’t let mistakes get you down. Just figure out how they happened and how to avoid making the same mistake next time.

Most opportunities do not work out and you should not expect them to. (If it were a sure thing, everyone would be doing it already.) Make sure you have several opportunities (this usually means several new communities) going on at once until something really begins to pay off. Then you can stop doing the other maybe-things and focus hard on what’s working.

At every step, you should be asking yourself these three questions:
* What worked?
* What didn’t work?
* What do I want to try next time?
You can do this at the end of the day, at the end of the week, at the end of the month, or even in the same hour between one conversation and the next. This is known as the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle and is a powerful method for solving many kinds of problems.
