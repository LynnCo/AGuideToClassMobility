[Lynn's opinion: ] For the ruling groups in current society, feminism can be anything from just some interesting information, to tips on how they can not be shitty to people around them. For marginalized individuals on the other hand, feminism provides an array of tools for the individual to combat oppression - especially on a personal level.

(insert here some stuff about how being born and raised marginalized instills into a person that their current state of affairs is somehow their own fault)

I know this belongs here! I just don't know the extent to which this belongs here and also how best to brand it
