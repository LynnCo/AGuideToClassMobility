Many part time jobs provide additional benefits focused on helping you complete courses in higher education. These companies will provide benefits and tuition assistance above and beyond your paycheck. Taking advantage of these programs can make a huge difference when attempting to balance school and work, especially when the work itself is solely in support of your greater goals.

### UPS ###
Yup, the brown trucks that deliver your packages. If you look you will find they have substations and general distribution centers in every major and minor city in the USA.
* They start at $11 an hour for part time work
* Schedules are often late in the evening or very early in the morning (think 2 AM). Often not great for an IRL social life, but rarely conflicts with school schedules.
* Part time work comes with full health benefits (dental, optical, general health) and **tuition assistance**!

TODO: starbucks info goes here


I know quite a few folks that started as the receptionist, learned some useful, bottom level IT skills that they could take over, and slowly became "real" IT folks. Companies are often supportive of this path; willing to pay for classes, especially if it is expanding on your current job description.
